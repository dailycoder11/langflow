What we will build

An advanced RAG-based, tool-orchestrated AI system that combines local ChromaDB knowledge retrieval, intent-based multi-agent routing, and Python-based execution for analytical and data-driven tasks.

How it works

User queries are routed based on intent. The selected agent retrieves relevant context from the local ChromaDB (via MCP), optionally calls tools such as web fetch, calculator, or a Python interpreter for complex computations, and synthesizes all outputs into a grounded response delivered through chat.
