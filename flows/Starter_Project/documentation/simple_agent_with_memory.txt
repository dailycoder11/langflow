What we will build

A stateful AI agent with short-term memory that can hold context across conversations, use external tools, and generate consistent, informed responses rather than treating every query in isolation.

How it works

Recent conversation history is retrieved and injected into a prompt template before being sent to the language model. The agent reasons over this context, selectively invokes tools (web, calculator, MCP services), produces a response, and stores the interaction back into memory for future turns.
